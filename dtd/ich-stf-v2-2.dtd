       The category element defines high level characteristics/parameters of the study
       Each category has a content value and has the attributes: name and info-type.
       The value in the info-type will allow a stylesheet to ignore or display the named
       characteristic/parameter.

	  name:         Identifies the characteristic/parameter class
	  info-type:    Used to indicate related characteristics/parameters which can filter
		               category for display or ignore
	  [category]   The specific value for the named characteristic/parameter class

 	study-document
 	
 	This is a container for providing tagging information described as SINGLE or
 	MULTIPLE (to facilitate description only) tags per file.  SINGLE files are provided
 	using the doc-content container described below.  MULTIPLE tag files are provided
 	using the content-block container which includes the doc-content container as an
 	attribute.
 	
     SINGLE tag file use doc-content described as:
     	xlink:href:	Contains the reference to the leaf ID in eCTD backbone index.xml file 

      	title:         	The full title of the study report as on the title page of the report
                     	which will be displayed by the review tool

      property:      An additional characteristic/parameter that may be required
                     	regionally to further describe a file-tag with the following
                     	attributes

      	name:			Describes the additional characteristic/parameter which may be needed
                     		regionally

     	info-type:  	Attribute value is used to indicate related characteristics/parameters
                     		which can be used to filter the name attribute for display or to ignore
                     		the item if not required regionally

      file-tag:		A container with name and info-type attributes.
      	name:    	   	The list of valid values for the name is controlled by the ICH default
                     		stylesheet and by regional schemas, guidance or stylesheets that may
                     		be needed regionally.  The name attribute holds the specific tag to be
                     		associated with the file.

     	info-type:  	Attribute value is used to indicate related characteristics/parameters
                     		which can be used to filter the name attribute for display or to ignore
                     		the item if not required regionally

     MULTIPLE tags per file use content-block describbed as:
           block-title:  		Used by the stylesheet as a section header for related items.
           property:			Same as described in SINGLE
           file-tag: 			Same as described in SINGLE
           doc-content  	Same as described in SINGLE
           content-block 	Provides for a hierarchical submission of related meta data.
